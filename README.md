# PortfolioAllocation

This project aims to optimize a portfolio of assets. The stochastic process for the share price prices will fitted, and the portfolios performance will then be simulated using Monte Carlo-methods.

At this date, the stochastic process used is a GARCH(1,1) process, improved to also consider the empirical aspect that volatility usually increases when the share price decreases and the volatility decreases when the share price increases. The stochastic process is given by,

...#TODO Finalize the definition of the process, estimation, and simulation.
